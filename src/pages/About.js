      Whatever the case, it's a day that deserves a party.

And by "party," who really even knows what we're talking about since parties are looking a little different these days. Instead of the 20+ person invite list we're used to, we've been forced to minimize that number by quite a bit, like to zero. We're taking to Zoom to host birthday celebrations and weddings instead of our normal IRL get togethers. We've had to adjust to a lot of the changes that come with our normal celebrations, but one thing that doesn't have to change is our love for a good cocktail in these changing times.

And what better way to make your boring Friday night into an actual party than by picking some cocktails from this list to try out? This list is full of refreshing juices, unexpected splashes of color, and seasonal flaves to wow even the most devoted vodka soda stans. Party of one or virtual party with friends or family, nothing will change how damn delicious these cocktails are. Keep scrolling for some classic cocktails and some new recipes that will definitely be added to your list of faves.
